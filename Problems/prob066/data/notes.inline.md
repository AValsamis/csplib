Datasets are taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). The format of the data files is as follows:

* File name: datasetName_#objects_#attributes_#clusters.txt.
* First line: number of objects.
* Then for the other lines: each line represents the coordinates of one object.

For some datasets the ground truth clusters (represented by labels) are known. This information can be used to compare the obtained clustering to the ground truth clustering. The labels of a dataset are in a file named datasetName_#objects_#attributes_#clusters_classes.txt. Each i-th line in these files gives the label of the cluster containing the i-th object.
